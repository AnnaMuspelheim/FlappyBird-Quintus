A FlappyBird remake using the Quintus HTML5 gaming engine.  Play it [here](http://ninemind.github.io/FlappyBird-Quintus). It's very small so zoom in (Ctrl +) in your browser to play it larger.  It also will look blurry in Chrome (except on OSX) since the browser does not yet support "nearest-neighbor"  rendering. Load it up in FireFox to keep the quality high when zooming.

Notice
======
The sounds & visuals for this game have been extracted from the original game and modified by me for performance.  There is no intention to steal Dong Nguyen's (the original creators) work. This was only an experiment to get myself and others familiarized with the Quintus HTML5 gaming engine.
